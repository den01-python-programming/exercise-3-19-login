# Exercise 3.19 Login

Write a program that recognizes the following users:

| username | password |
| -------- | -------- |
| grace     | hopper |
| emma     | haskell  |

The program either shows a personal message or informs of an incorrect username or password.

```plaintext
Enter username: **grace**
Enter password: **hopper**
You have successfully logged in!
```

```plaintext
Enter username: **emma**
Enter password: **haskell**
You have successfully logged in!
```

```plaintext
Enter username: **alex**
Enter password: **thunderstorm**
Incorrect username or password!
```

**NB!** Logins should not be implemented like this in real life! You can become familiar with safer ways to implement logins on courses focusing on web programming.
